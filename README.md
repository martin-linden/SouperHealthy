# SouperHealthy

This project was part of the UX implementation course at KYH in Stockholm during autumn 2020. The project is developed after a carefully worked UX work and design prototype. Some changes from the original design are made after constructive feedback.

This was my very first Angular project and was a very difficult challenge in the limited time.

## Built with [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Figma prototype

You will find the project prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/file/fnJMttumMt8u1YKbhGxVOD/Souper-Healthy?node-id=0%3A1)
